# FIGSiM - Finite Improbability Generator for Simulation of Materials

This code is the open-source (UIUC/NCSA license) version of the Monte-Carlo simulation package originally developed at in Prof. Bruce H. Robinson's lab at the Chemistry Department of the University of Washington, Seattle.

# Build instructions

The included Makefile *should* be reasonably equipped to compile the code (and find out if OpenCL is available) on most Linux and Mac OS X environments. Type "make" and find out...

# Running the code

The created executable, MCfig, needs a configuration file (text file with the extension conf) to be useful. There are a handful of examples in the testconfigs/ folder.

The result of this endeavour will be a trajectory file (text file with extension traj) which can then be further scrutinized using a variety of included tools.

# Documentation

Amazingly some of us are working on it and so there is finite improbability it will appear here at some point...
